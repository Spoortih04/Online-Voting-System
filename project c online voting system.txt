🗳️ Project Title:
Online Voting System using C Programming

📌 Objective:
To develop a simple console-based application that allows users to vote for a list of candidates, view voting results, and display the winner using the C programming language.

🧠 Project Description:
This project simulates an online voting system through a terminal interface. It enables users to:

View a list of candidates.

Cast a vote for their preferred candidate.

Display the total number of votes received by each candidate.

Determine and announce the winner based on the vote count.

It is a basic implementation that focuses on control structures, arrays, and functions in C and is suitable for beginners.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
Language: C Programming

Compiler: GCC / Turbo C / Code::Blocks / Dev-C++

Platform: Console (Terminal/Command Prompt)

👨‍💻 Key Functionalities:
Feature	Description
Cast Vote	User votes for a candidate by entering the candidate number.
View Results	Displays current vote count for each candidate.
Find Winner	Identifies and shows the candidate with the highest number of votes.
Exit	Terminates the application.

🔍 Modules Breakdown:
Candidate Management

Uses an array of strings to store candidate names.

Voting Logic

Tracks vote count using an array of integers.

Input validation to ensure correct voting options.

Result Calculation

Loops through the vote count array to find the candidate with the most votes.

📈 Future Improvements (Optional Enhancements):
Add user authentication with voter IDs.

Prevent multiple voting by the same user.

Store votes in a file or database for persistence.

Provide graphical UI using C graphics or port to a web/mobile app.

Encrypt votes for security.

✅ Conclusion:
The project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of C programming applied to real-world scenarios. It helps understand arrays, input/output, control structures, and function calls while simulating an important civic process — voting.
